Kelvin did the add expenses portion.
Kelvin: I felt that communication between the group could be a bit better although having partners definitely made the workload much easier. I enjoy collaborative coding for the reason mentioned earlier.
Marc Floyd: I wrote and organized the main body and the organization of expenses. A challenge of this assignment is the merging of each other's code. It took some time for things to work but by talking to each other on how we could connect our ideas, we managed to do it. Our group is satisfied with collaborative coding as it gives us less workload 
Zack Belarmino: I believe working on the code together was quite exquisite and Do believe that collaberating makes the Progress of work much more faster and is something I would be interested in doing again.
but grants us the ability to create something amazing.
collaborators are Zack, noah, kelvin and marc
