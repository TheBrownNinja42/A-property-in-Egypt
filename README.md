Kelvin did the add expenses portion.
Kelvin: I felt that communication between the group could be a bit better although having partners definitely made the workload much easier. I enjoy collaborative coding for the reason mentioned earlier.
Marc Floyd: I wrote the main body and the organization of expenses. A challenge of this assignment is the merging of each other's code. It took some time for things to work but by talking to each other on how we could connect our ideas, we managed to do it. Our group is satisfied with collaborative coding as it gives us less workload but grants us the ability to create something amazing.
collaborators are sac, noah, kelvin and marc
