Kelvin did the add expenses portion.
Kelvin: I felt that communication between the group could be a bit better although having partners definitely made the workload much easier. I enjoy collaborative coding for the reason mentioned earlier.
Marc Floyd: I typed and organized the main body by making my member's work fit together without any errors. I also did the organization of expenses. A challenge of this assignment is the merging of each other's code. It took some time for things to work but by talking to each other on how we could connect our ideas, we managed to do it. Our group is satisfied with collaborative coding as it gives us less workload to create something amazing. 
Zack Belarmino: I believe working on the code together was quite exquisite and Do believe that collaberating makes the Progress of work much more faster and is something I would be interested in doing again.
but grants us the ability to create something amazing.
Noah Tecle: I did the monthly expenses part i think that the group couldve communicated and coordinated ourselves better but i found the collaborating was fun but slightly challenging but i would not be aganist the idea of doing it again HUZZAHH!!!
collaborators are Zack, noah, kelvin and marc
